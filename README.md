The Task

In this assignment you are required to design, implement and test a program that can be used to
manage a simple personal diary with appointment records, which are stored in an array.

Your program must provide an interactive editing environment that allows the user to:

create new appointment records and add them to the diary;

display all appointment records with details;

tally all appointments for summary of the diary;

shuffle appointment records;

sort all appointment records based on an attribute

The program is to be implemented by JavaScript and as an .html file running on Firefox, an OS
independent web browser.
