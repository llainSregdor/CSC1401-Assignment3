I've made a few edits in the gitHub container. Just trying to keep things a bit organised. I've kept the 'main.html' where we'll keep the unified code. I've created a few new files, one for each function. I think it's easier to debug code when you divide and conquer.

I’ve been messing around with the show appointment function again this morning without much success but running out of time now as i have to go back to work.
- ive tried to get the selections in the IDE to contribute to the array rather than the prompts
-attempted to reference them to the array by using getElementById
-tried to output them as a table

i think i have the basics there, but still needs a bit of tinkering as its not really working as i hoped. would either of you guys mind having a bit of a look over it and see if you can see where im slipping up.

ill just email you this update as the previous addition to github is working so want to just leave it as it is.
i have to sleep at work tonite and work all day tomorrow but start four days off from saturday so can put in a bit more effort then

Note the second while loop is just printing each of the array elements (the appointments) to the screen. I used this for troubleshooting purposes. The actual code we want to build on is lines 6-21. If you want to test it yourself just remove the /* */ comment tags.

I'll upload the code to github shortly. I'll turn it into a function and add the other appointment details to it first.

I've cleaned it up into a simple function and uploaded to GitHub. I started a 'main' file there. I'm not sure how GitHub is normally utilised so feel free to restructure the document however is necessary.

Was someone working on the user interface? That part seems quite time consuming.
